# Scarry will load this scene first
entryScene: title

# Defines the base size of all scenes. While scarry may display
# at a different resolution, all assets and positions will be
# adjusted proportionally - eg. a 2560x1440 image will always
# cover the entire stage, even if scarry is rendering at 1280x720.

# SPRITES ===========================================================
# All sprites and sprite animations used in scenes are
# defined here
sprites:
  # At its simplest, a sprite can be defined as just an image
  background: "images/background.jpg"

  # Spritesheets are marked with "type: spritesheet", and
  # allow for definition of multiple animations from one
  # file
  animatedSprite:
    type: spritesheet
    file: "images/spritesheet.png"

    # Allows scarry to break the sheet up into an x by y grid of
    # equally sized images
    frameCounts: { x: 10, y:3 }

    # The frame displayed when the sprite is loaded
    defaultFrame: { x: 0, y: 0 }

    animations:
      walk:
        startFrame: { x: 0, y: 0 }

        # Frames are increased from left to right, moving down
        # the spritesheet. In this example, the last frame of the
        # animation would be (0, 1)
        count: 11
